# Usage Guide

## Basic Usage

- Click `Generate` in the menu in the top right
- Drag and scroll to pan and zoom
- Open the `Style` folder to access styling options - Switch to `GoogleNoZoom` to see 3D buildings, or `Google` to see buildings when zoomed in
- You can turn 3D buildings on/off for any style with `buildingModels`
- When `zoomBuildings` is enabled, buildings are only shown when zoomed in

High-DPI displays: This will impact pan+zoom performance.

### Download City
You can download the city as a `.png`, `.svg`, `.stl`, or as a heightmap. The downloaded image will contain what's on screen, so if you're zoomed in, that's all that will be contained in the image.
Use `imageScale` to control the resolution of the downloaded `.png` - higher imageScale for higher resolution.

To download a heightmap, select the 'Heightmap' style from the Style folder, and download an image as usual.
See [Heightmap](heightmap.md) for more details.

## Performance

- The size of the generated world depends on your zoom + pan when you click generate
- The more zoomed in you are, the smaller the map and the faster it will generate
- 3D buildings slow down pan+zoom, but not generation time. If the FPS is too low, you can turn them on when you want them with the `buildingModels` option under `Style`

## Advanced Usage:

### Tensor Field

Cities are generated using  tensor field. If you open the `Tensor Field` folder you'll be able to view and edit it. You can add and remove grid elements. Use the red squares to drag them to different positions. Under the folder corresponding to each element, you can change its size and decay. You can also change the angle of the fields.

Click `setRecommended` in the tensor field folder to have the tool place 4 grids and one radial field in the scene. These have random parameters, so click multiple times until you find one you like.
Alternatively, add radial or grid fields manually. You can drag them to set their positions, and edit their parameters in the folders that appear.

!> **Important** The `generate` button in the top level of the menu randomises the tensor field. To work with your edited tensor field, you need to open the `Maps` folder and use the various generate buttons there.

### Maps

Open the `Maps` folder to start creating roads. You can click `generateEverything` or step through the process manually.

- **Water** - generate until you find a sea and river combination you like. Under the params folders, you can change the noise parameters to control how rough the shore and river bank are. The `simplifyTolerance` controls how closely the road follows the waterline.
- **Roads** - There are three road sizes: `main`, `major`, `minor`. Under each of the folders, you can click generate to create each class of roads individually. You can go back and edit the tensor field at any point in this process to create roads on different tensor fields. Experiment.
- **Buildings** - click `addBuildings` to fill the city with buildings. If you can't see them, the chosen style might not display buildings, or you might not be zoomed in enough. The `Default` style, and `GoogleNoZoom` styles both show buildings at all zoom levels. You can change the minimum building size, and the sidewalk size with `shrinkSpacing`.
- **Animation** - Generation will be faster if you untick 'Animate', but note that this will swamp the UI thread so you won't be able to pan, zoom, or retry until generation has completed. Animation speed gives you a tradeoff between FPS and generation time.

## Recommended Workflow

Here are the steps I usually take when I use the tool:

- **Water First** - I open the `Map/Water` folder and click `Generate` until I'm happy with the water features.
- **Tensor Field Detail** - Opening the `Tensor` folder reveals the tensor field. I `addRadial` a couple of times to add some roundabouts. I `addGrid` a few times and change their size, decay, and position to vary the grid structure.
- **Roads** - I step through each of the `Main`, `Major`, `Minor` folders `Generate`ing roads at each stage, moving to the next when I'm happy. Increase `numParks` under `Map/Params` if you want more parks.
- **Buildings** - `Buildings/AddBuildings`

## Editing Colour Themes

The file containing the available colour schemes is [src/colour_schemes.json](https://github.com/ProbableTrain/MapGenerator/blob/master/src/colour_schemes.json). In future you'll be able to edit these in the web editor, but for now you have to build the project yourself to add colour schemes.
Edit this file to add a colour scheme, and it will automatically be included in the drop down menu. Currently, new colour schemes cannot have the hand-drawn look, but this will be changed in future.
